This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in PHP object handling: the distinction between assignment (creating a copy) and using references. The `bug.php` file shows code that unexpectedly modifies the original object due to a simple assignment, while `bugSolution.php` offers a corrected approach using references if that's the intended behavior.
